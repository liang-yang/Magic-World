[GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

A ++code hosting++ platform for version control and collaboration.

### Repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project.

### Branch

Branch is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time.

### Commit

On GitHub, saved changes are called commits.

### Pull Request

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

### Merge
